> A simple way to sketch with Python and p5.js in Jupyter

This little experiment aims to simplify the process of teaching creative coding with Jupyter notebooks. It uses the [Skulpt](https://github.com/skulpt/skulpt/) Python implementation to create a wrapper for [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js).
